<!-- <h2>NCI Surgery Branch Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) Modular Facility </h2> -->
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Cancer Institute (NCI) will operate the Tumor Infiltrating
    Lymphocytes (TIL) production facility to serve the NCI surgery branch. The modular facility will be located in
    the lot south of Building 10 and between Building 30 and Building 49 on the NIH Bethesda campus. </p>

<p>
    This project will relocate the existing NCI TILâ€™s cGMP Facility from Building 10. The new modular facility
    will provide more space for the NCI Surgery Branch, enabling them to provide greater throughput of TIL
    production. The new manufacturing program operated in this facility will comply with the latest FDA
    requirements and regulations to produce cell products for use in Phase I and Phase II clinical studies. The
    space is approximately 6,000 gross square feet and is currently under construction.
</p>
<p>
    The design of the new facility will be independent of the existing operation and systems. New environmental
    systems are being specifically designed to service this area and dedicated to the new facility space so as
    not to contaminate or interfere with the current operation.
</p>
<p>
    The facility design includes three independent operating suites for cellular processing. People, material,
    and waste flows into and through the suites are the same. The individual suites are provided to allow
    separation of simultaneous processes to assure containment, and to limit potential cross contamination.
    Central support functions will be performed within the TIL modular building. Airlocks and material
    pass-through devices are provided to transfer material between support operations and production suites. The
    overall layout includes separate gowning and de-gowning pathways for movement of personnel.
</p>
<p>
    The building has primarily modular construction, though some portions of the facility, including the entry
    vestibule and stairwells to access the second floor, will be built conventionally. Mechanical and electrical
    equipment serving the production space will be housed in the second floor of the modular facility and a
    small area of the first floor. Some plant utilities, including cooling water and emergency power, will be
    provided from Building 30, but otherwise the building houses all functions and equipment necessary for its
    operation.
</p>
<p>
    The mechanical systems include 100% outside air, two (2) dedicated air handling units, and individual room
    terminal air units that will supply and control air changes, temperature, humidity, and differential
    pressure. All supply air to the classified rooms is HEPA filtered. There are two (2) dedicated exhaust units
    with exhaust discharged outdoors via a common vertical stack.
