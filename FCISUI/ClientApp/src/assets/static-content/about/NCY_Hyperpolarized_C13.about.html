    <h2>Clinical Center NCI Hyperpolarized C-13 Facility</h2>
    <p>
        The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Cancer Institute (NCI) will operate the Hyperpolarization
        Contrast Facility (HCF) to perform investigational human trials. This facility will be operated by the Molecular
        Imaging Program of NCI and is located in the NIH Bethesda Campus, Bldg 10, room B3B402A, which is directly
        across the hall from the SpinLab and MRI scan room. The space is approximately 125 square feet.

            This facility is designed as a Segregated Compounding Area (SCAa) in accordance with USP <823> for an
                investigational injectable hyperpolarized contrast agent. The aseptic work station is recirculating
                (laminar flow bench (LAFW), which has a cleanliness rating of ISO 5 to insure protection of the final
                product. The floors, walls, ceilings, doors, and windows will be smooth, with a finish that is durable,
                cleanable, and compatible with cleaning chemicals.

            A hand free sink is located in the clean side of the anteroom. The following gases will be piped into the
            SCAa from gas cylinders located in the equipment room across the hall: High purity compressed helium, High
            purity nitrogen gas, Ultra‚Äêhigh purity compressed air

        </p>
        <p>
            An existing air handling unit will provide 100% outdoor air to this facility. Both the anteroom and SCAa
            will be provided with a minimum of 12 air changes per hour (ACH) and provided with dedicated supply and
            exhaust air terminal units. Supply air to each room will be HEPA filtered by the used of fan aided ceiling
            mounted HEPA filter type diffusers.
        </p>
        <p>

            BAS System will be provided for the anteroom and SCAa rooms and will control and monitor the space
            environmental parameters (Temp, %RH, dP). A new dedicated Equipment and Environmental Monitoring System
            (EMS) shall be provided to monitor the space environmental parameters (Temp, %RH, dP). The EMS will be a
            qualified system.
