    <h2>Clinical Center - DLM Sterility Lab </h2>
    <p> The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center (CC) Department of Laboratory Medicine (DLM) provides
        sterility testing services for various Institutes/Centers (ICs)
        on a wide range of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products (including investigational new drugs) to assure
        patient safety. The Sterility Testing Laboratory located in Building 10,
        ACRF, in rooms 2C450, 25452, and 2C458 will be state-of-the-art and in compliance with cGMP
        requirements/processes.
        This facility will meet classified International Standards Organization (ISO) requirements. The space is
        approximately 750 gross square feet.</p>

            This project is in design. </p>

        <p> The Sterility Testing Laboratory entrance will be in the DLM Corridor. The laboratory will be divided into
            two main suites with applicable support facilities (e.g. gowning rooms, air locks, pass-throughs). These two
            suites are defined as a Sterility Testing room and a BSL-2 Culture room and will be accessed via a common
            gowning and de-gowning room. There will be bidirectional anterooms associated with each of the two suites.
            All sterile work will be performed inside the ISO Class 5 BSCs located in the ISO 7 Testing and Culture
            rooms.
        </p>

            HVAC to the Sterility Laboratory will initially be served from the existing 100% outside air Pathology Air
            Handler AHU-8A/B. The HVAC supply service will be migrated to the labâ€™s dedicated redundant air handling
            units once the new Mechanical Penthouse is built (year 2021). The design will include individual room
            terminal air units that will supply and control air changes, temperature, humidity, and differential
            pressure. All supply air to the classified rooms will be HEPA filtered. There will be two (2) dedicated
            redundant exhausts units located on the roof.
