<!-- <h2>NCI Surgery Branch, Vector Production Facility Suite (10/1B42)</h2> -->
<p> The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surgery Branch Vector Production
    Facility (VPF) in Suite 1B42 includes approximately 220 gross square feet of aseptic processing laboratory
    cleanroom designated for vector production and cell manipulation to support the National Cancer Institute’s
    Surgery Branch. The facility is located in Building 10 on the first floor, C Wing. The VPF manufactures
    replication-incompetent viral vectors (retroviral, lentiviral, and AAV) that are used to genetically engineer
    human lymphocytes to express T cell receptors (TCR) and chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) that recognize antigens
    expressed by human cancers. </p>

<p>
    The VPF supplies these viral vectors to the Surgery Branch cell production facility that utilizes these
    products to manufacture cell-based therapies for patients with advanced metastatic cancer.
</p>
<p>The production room is designed to provide a contained manufacturing area suitable for aseptic manufacture of
    cGMP or Good Tissue Practice (GTP) products. The lab is designated as a BSL- 2, which reflects the moderate
    risk these products pose to personnel involved in the manufacture of these viral vectors. Because it will be
    used for Phase 1 Investigational Drugs, it is also treated as an Aseptic Processing Facility (APF) in
    compliance with cGMP and Good Tissue Practice (GTP).</p>
<p>
    The walls and ceiling of the VPF are engineered polymer panels detailed to be flush, smooth, hard, and
    chemically resistant. The doors are Glass Reinforced Polyester (GRP) with stainless steel frames, equipped
    with hands-free operators. All fixtures and furnishings are cleanroom grade. The floors are welded, seamless
    sheet vinyl.
</p>

<p>To establish and maintain the required ISO classification of the VPF’s cleanroom, the supply air is
    HEPA-filtered and differential air pressures between rooms are used to mitigate the risk of both outside
    particulate entering the space and manufacturing material from escaping the space. The suite is supported by
    the building main air-handling system for primary air utilized for room pressurization and humidity control.
    The production cleanroom has a dedicated air handler, located in the adjacent mechanical room, which
    provides recirculation air to achieve the required 40 air changes per hour. A single chiller is dedicated to
    the 1B42 suite in order to provide 66 deg. F temperature control in the cleanrooms. The facility’s exhaust
    is supported by redundant rooftop exhaust fans. CO2 and CA manifolded tanks located in the adjacent
    mechanical room provide high purity gas to the incubators and lab equipment.
</p>
<p>The primary engineering controls for the VPF are two ISO 5 classified Type II A2 BSCs, located in an ISO 7
    clean room. All open manipulation portions will be conducted within these BSCs. Two BSCs are located in the
    GMP vector production room, which is constructed and qualified to ISO-7 requirements. This ISO 7 buffer room
    is negatively pressurized to an ISO 7 airlock, which is positive to the ISO 8 entry room, which is positive
    to the corridor and beyond. The building BAS system monitors and controls the space while an EMS system
    provides validated monitoring of the critical environmental parameters. The EMS system also monitors
    temperature for the incubators, refrigerators, and freezers.
