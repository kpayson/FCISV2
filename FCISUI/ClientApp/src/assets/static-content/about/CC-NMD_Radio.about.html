<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center (CC) Nuclear Medicine (NM) Radiopharmacy & Biologics
    Radiolabeling facility, located on the first floor of Building 10, shall be designed to be USP and FDA
    compliant, employing cGMP principals and best practices for investigational and clinical injectable radioactive
    drugs. The space is approximately 1,215 gross square feet.
</p>

<p>This project is in design. </p>
<p> The NM Radiopharmacy area includes two operating cleanroom suites for testing. One suite has been designed
    to accommodate traditional radiopharmaceuticals (the “Kit Clean Room”), the other for radiolabeled cell
    therapy products (the “Biologics Clean Room”). The individual suites are provided to allow separation of
    parallel processes to ensure containment and limit potential cross contamination.
</p>
<p> The facility shall accommodate multiple processes, most independent of one another, with a flexible layout
    that shall permit bidirectional ingress/egress via anteroom or pass-throughs for flexibility.

</p>
<p>All processing areas will handle unsealed sources of radioactive material (RAM). All Primary Engineering
    Controls (PEC) used for these processes shall be internally shielded.</p>
<p>In addition to the main NM Radiopharmacy renovation, there are existing Dosing rooms, Radiopharmacy offices,
    and patient waiting areas that will be moved to accommodate the new NM Radiopharmacy facility footprint.</p>
<p> The mechanical systems include 100% outside air, two (2) dedicated redundant air handling units located in
    new Mechanical Penthouse, and individual room terminal air units that will supply and control air changes,
    temperature, humidity, and differential pressure. All supply air to the classified rooms will be HEPA
    filtered. There will be two (2) dedicated redundant exhaust fans located outdoors. </p>
