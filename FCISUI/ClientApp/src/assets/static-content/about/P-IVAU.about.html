<!-- <h2>Clinical Center Permanent-Intravenous Admixture Unit (P-IVAU) Pharmacy</h2> -->
<p>The National Institute of Health Clinical Center (CC) Pharmacy will operate the Permanent Intravenous Admixture
    Unit (I-IVAU) which will provide a wide variety of compounded sterile drug products to Clinical Center patients.
    The P-IVAU space will be located within the Building 10 Clinical Center on the first floor. The overall P-IVAU
    space will be approximately 10,000 gross square feet of program space, with 5,500 gross square of APF spaces.
    The facility will prepare drugs according to the requirements of USP<797>, USP<800>, USP<795> and BSL-2
                standards. </p>

<p>
    The APF spaces consists of one (1) <797> suite for sterile non-hazardous IV preparations, one (1) <800>
            suite for preparation of sterile hazardous preparations, and one (1) BSL-2 suite for hazardous
            sterile preparations.

</p>
<p>The <797> sterile non-hazardous suite consists of six (6) ISO 7 compounding rooms, each with a Type A2 ISO 5
        BSC and dedicated incoming and outgoing ventilated pass-throughs. The suite will have separate gowning
        and de-gowning rooms with a common ISO 7 corridor that serves the compounding rooms. The rooms will be
        arranged so pressure is cascading out from the ISO 7 Sterile Prep room out to the common corridor and to
        the ISO 8 gowning and de-gowning room. </p>
<p>
    The <800> sterile hazardous suite consists of four (4) ISO 7 compounding rooms, each with a Type B2 ISO 5
        BSC and dedicated incoming and outgoing ventilated pass-throughs. The suite will share the entry gowning
        room with the BSL-2 suite but will be have dedicated entry to a common corridor that serves the four (4)
        rooms. The two (2) <800> rooms will share a common de-gowning room. The suite is unidirectional so the
            worker will exit the compounding room through a de-gowning room, thus avoiding re-entry into the
            entry corridor where cross contamination could occur between compounding rooms. The rooms will be
            arranged so the <800> rooms are negatively pressurized relative to the common corridor, but the
                suite itself is possible to common spaces.

</p>

<p>
    The BSL-2 sterile hazardous suite consists of two (2) ISO 7 compounding rooms, each with a Type B2 ISO 5 BSC
    and dedicated incoming and outgoing ventilated pass-throughs. The suite will share the entry gowning room
    with the <800> suite but will be have dedicated entry to a common corridor that serves the two (2) rooms.
        The two (2) BSL-2 rooms will share a common de-gowning room. The suite is unidirectional so the worker
        will exit the compounding room through a de-gowning room, thus avoiding re-entry into the entry corridor
        where cross contamination could occur between compounding rooms. The rooms will be arranged so the BSL-2
        rooms are negatively pressurized relative to the common corridor, but the suite itself is positive to
        common spaces.

</p>
<p>
    There will be two (2) kitting rooms in the pharmacy where drug and supplies will be stored. One (1) kitting
    room is for non-hazardous drug and supply storage, and one (1) kitting room for <800> Hazardous drug
        storage. Each kitting room will have a high-density storage carousel designed for use in a cleanroom
        environment.
</p>
<p>
    Next to the APF area there will be an Inpatient Unit Dose Section that serves patients that are staying and
    being treated in the hospital. This area will feature a large robotic prescription dispensing system, a
    high-density carousel, refrigerators, shelves, and a workstation area for 4-6 people. There will also be an
    Outpatient Section which serves medications to patients that are being treated as outpatients. This section
    includes an Outpatient Waiting Area with three (3) consultation windows for outpatients for pick up.
    Finally, there will be two (2) additional high-density carousels that will store Investigational drugs and
    drugs that are shared between Inpatient and Outpatient departments.
</p>
<p>
    A new mechanical penthouse will be installed above an adjacent roof to house (2) dedicated air handling
    units and other necessary HVAC and electrical equipment. The terminal air units that supply and control air
    changes, temperature, humidity, and differential pressure will be located in the mechanical interstitial
    space above the program spaces. All supply air to the classified rooms is HEPA filtered. There will be two
    (2) sets of dedicated exhaust systems, one set for the general exhaust and one set for the hazardous
    exhaust.
