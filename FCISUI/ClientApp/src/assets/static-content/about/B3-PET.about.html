  <p> The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center (CC) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Department
    operates the PET facility for the manufacture of research of PET doses for the NIH Clinical Center. The facility is
    regulated by US Pharmacopeia General Chapter <823> Radiopharmaceuticals for Positron Emission Tomography. The total
      cGMP space is approximately 7,456 gross square feet with an additional 9,332 gross square feet of associated
      research laboratory, mechanical, and penthouse spaces, and the facility is located on the B3 level of Building 10.

    The PET Radiochemistry facility is co-located with other aseptic processing functions, adjacent to the cyclotron
    and hot cells. This facility consists of one (1) ISO 7 positively pressurized Laminar Flow Hood room in the Hot
    Cell Laboratory, one (1) ISO 8 negatively pressurized anteroom, and one (1) ISO 7 positively pressurized clean
    room. These are supported by an analytical lab, supply/inventory storage, receiving and receiving quarantine
    storage, and a prep area. An ISO 5 environment is maintained in the Biological Safety Cabinet and Laminar Flow
    Hood.

  <p>
    The clean room suite is designed to provide a multi-directional flow of personnel, equipment, and materials, with
    separated entry and de-gown airlocks to protect from contamination and to ensure the integrity of clean processes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The mechanical systems include two (2) dedicated air handling units and four (4) terminal air units that will
    supply and control air changes, temperature, humidity, and differential pressure. All supply air to the classified
    rooms is HEPA filtered. There is a dedicated exhaust system with redundant exhaust fans.
