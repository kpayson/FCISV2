    <h2>Clinical Center, Pilot Bioproduction Facility (PBF) </h2><br />

    <p>
        The National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) will operate the Pilot Bioproduction Facility
        in
        room B1G09l located in the basement of Building 29B at the NIH Bethesda site. The Pilot Plant is approximately
        720 square feet.
        The facility is designed to support campaigned process operations that are used to generate clinical scale Bulk
        Drug Substance (BDS).
        These operations include fermentation, purification, and subsequent conjugation of recombinant malarial protein
        and carrier protein.
        The generated BDS is planned for use in phase 1 and 2 vaccine trials and therefore, the Process Suite is also
        treated as a
        classified production facility in compliance with cGMPs.
        The facility is currently in design with anticipated turnover by December of 2021.
