    <h2>Clinical Center, Center for Cellular Engineering (CCE) 2J Facility (10/2J)</h2>
    <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Center for Cellular Engineering (CCE) operates the 2J facility for the
        manufacture of Phase I and
        II clinical materials to support the development of autologous and allogeneic cell therapies. The facility
        complies with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).
        The space is approximately
        7,100 gross square feet, including the 2J and 1J mechanical rooms, and is located on the 2nd floor of the J wing
        in Building 10. </p>
        <div id="collapse" style="display:none">
        <p>
            The facility consists of five (5) ISO 7 positively pressurized Tissue Culture rooms, one (1) ISO 7
            negatively pressurized infectious room, two (2) ISO 7 equipment storage rooms,
            an ISO 7 clean freezer, a CNC storage freezer room, a common ISO 7 corridor, gowning/de-gowning areas,
            a supply room, clean and dirty janitorsâ€™ closets, and administrative areas. An ISO 5 environment for tissue
            work is maintained in the Biological Safety Cabinets.
        </p>
        <p>Tissue Culture Rooms are designed to provide a multi-directional flow of personnel, equipment, and materials.
            The infectious suite is designed to be uni-directional with separated entry and de-gown airlocks to protect
            from
            contamination and to ensure the integrity of clean processes. </p>
        <p>
            The mechanical systems include two (2) dedicated air handling units, eleven (11) recirculating air units,
            and approximately forty-seven (47) terminal air units that will supply and
            control air changes, temperature, humidity, and differential pressure. All supply air to the classified
            rooms is HEPA filtered.
            There are two (2) sets of dedicated exhaust systems, one set for the general exhaust and one set for the
            infectious suites.
