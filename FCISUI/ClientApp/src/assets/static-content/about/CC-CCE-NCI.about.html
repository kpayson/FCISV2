    <h2>Clinical Center, Center for Cellular Engineering (CCE) East Terrace Modular Facility</h2>
    <p> The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Center for Cellular Engineering (CCE) will operate the spaces on the
        Building 10 East Terrace adjacent to the existing Building 10.
        This new facility is designed to support revised practices intended to enhance product separation and compliance
        with 21 CFR 1271 and related cGMP expectations.
        The new facility will be used to prepare a variety of products that are derived from human cells.
        No vector production is planned for this facility, which is approximately 3,300 gross square feet. This APF is
        currently under construction. </p>

            The East Terrace Modular has been designed to operate independently of the base building systems of Building
            10.
            These systems include temperature, humidity, ACH, and pressurization control;
            they are dedicated and redundant, designed not to interfere with current operations of the base building.
        </p>
        <p>The facility design includes four (4) independent operating suites for advanced processing â€“ as these
            advanced processing suites exceed the requirements for basic processing,
            they may also be used to perform basic processing as needed. The suites have been designed to accommodate a
            variety of product types and associated risks. People, material,
            and waste flows into and through the suites are the same for all product types and manufacturing
            complexities.
            The individual suites are provided to allow separation of simultaneous processes to assure containment and
            to limit potential cross contamination.</p>
        <p>
            Central support functions will be performed within the East Terrace Modular building. Donor material and
            final product will be stored in the cryo-freezer room and supplies will be stored in the clean supply room,
            both located adjacent to the processing suites. Solutions for processing will be from commercial sources,
            with final preparation to be performed as needed within the process suites.
            Airlocks and material pass-through devices are provided to transfer material between support operations and
            production suites.
            Sourcing, storage, solution preparation, and movement of material will all be performed in accordance with
            approved procedures.
        </p>
        <p>
            The overall layout includes two corridors: a supply corridor for movement of clean materials and personnel,
            and a return corridor for the movement of sealed finished product, samples, de-gowned personnel, and waste.

        </p>
        <p>
            The building has primarily modular construction, though some portions of the facility, including the entry
            vestibule, cylinder storage space, and stairwells to access the 2nd floor, will be built conventionally. The
            facility will be built on an existing terrace at the northeast corner of Building 10. Mechanical and
            electrical equipment serving the production space will be housed in the second floor of the modular facility
            and the conventionally built portions of the first floor. Some plant utilities, including cooling water,
            heating water, and emergency power, will be provided from Building 10, but otherwise the building houses all
            functions and equipment necessary for its operation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The mechanical systems include 100% outside air, two (2) dedicated air handling units, and individual room
            terminal air units that will supply and control air changes, temperature, humidity, and differential
            pressure. All supply air to the classified rooms is HEPA filtered. There are two (2) dedicated exhausts
            units with exhaust discharged outdoors via a common vertical stack.
