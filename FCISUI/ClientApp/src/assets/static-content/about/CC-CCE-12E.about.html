    <h2>Clinical Center, Center for Cellular Engineering (CCE) 12E Facility</h2>
    <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Center for Cellular Engineering (CCE) will operate the spaces on the 12th
        floor of the E wing in Building 10.
        This new facility is designed to support revised practices intended to enhance product separation and compliance
        with 21 CFR 1271 and related cGMP expectations. The new facility will be used to prepare a variety of products
        that are derived from human cells.
        No vector production is planned for this facility. The space is approximately 12,145 gross square feet. This APF
        design is complete. </p>

        <p>
            The design of the new facility will be independent of the existing operation and systems for the E wing. Any
            system that has direct impact on the operation of the new facility will be dedicated to the new facility.
            New environmental systems are being specifically designed to service this area and will be dedicated to the
            new facility space.
        </p>
        <p> The facility design includes seven (7) independent operating suites for advanced processing, and two (2)
            process suites for basic processing.
            The seven (7) advanced suites have been designed to accommodate a variety of product types and hazards. The
            flows into the suites, flows of support functions,
            and flows through the suites are all very similar. The individual suites are provided to allow separation of
            parallel processes to assure containment and to
            limit potential cross contamination. Central support functions, such as storage and solution prep, are
            adjacent to the process suites to reduce the travel and time required to
            transport materials. Most of the support functions are located in ISO 8 environments.
            Airlocks and material pass-through devices are provided to transfer material between support operations and
            production suites.</p>

        <p> The overall layout includes two corridors: a supply corridor for movement of clean materials, personnel, and
            equipment, and a return corridor for sealed finished product, samples, de-gowned personnel, and waste.</p>
        <p>
            The mechanical systems include 100% outside air, two (2) dedicated air handling units, and individual room
            terminal air units that will supply and control air changes, temperature, humidity, and differential
            pressure.
            All supply air to the classified rooms is HEPA filtered. There are two (2) sets of dedicated exhaust
            systems, one set for the general exhaust and one set for a single infectious suite.
            The mechanical systems are located on the 13th floor penthouse directly
            above 12E and provide ease of access to maintenance staff without necessitating entry into the clean room
            spaces.</p>
        <strong>This facility is under development.</strong>
