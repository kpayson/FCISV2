    <div id="collapse" style="display: none">

        <p>Trailer-1 is a 3-room modular cleanroom which consists of three (3) physically separated ISO Classified
            rooms: Entry Room (CNC), Anteroom (ISO 8), and Cleanroom (ISO 7), totaling approximately 400 square feet.
            Trailer-1 complies with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and is operated with positive pressure,
            cascading contamination control. </p>
        <p>
            Trailer 2 consists of a 3-room, modular controlled environment trailer for storage and additional workspace,
            along with an airlock/changing room vestibule which connects the two trailers. This facility is located
            adjacent to the Building 10 West Ambulance entrance.

        </p>
        <p>The mechanical systems for both trailers are independent and include a single 100% outside air handling unit
            and terminal units that supply and control air changes, temperature, humidity, and differential pressure.
            Cooling and heating are provided from independent chiller and electrical based heaters. All supply air to
            all the rooms is HEPA filtered while exhaust in the clean room is also HEPA filtered before leaving the
            rooms via a low wall-mounted HEPA filter housing. There are two (2) sets of exhaust systems, one for general
            exhaust and one set for the BSCs.</p>
