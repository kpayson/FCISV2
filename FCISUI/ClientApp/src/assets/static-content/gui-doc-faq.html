                    </strong>
                    <p>Legacy facilities are those who perform activities that are similar to those performed in APFs, but either pre-date the start of the APF program, or were earlier granted this status due to the low risk inherent in the activities performed. There is an initiative being planned to transition the enduring legacy facilities into full APF status, including documentation, oversight and support, that is pending approval and implementation. Non-enduring facilities, being those which have a planned obsolescence and removal from service will continued to be retired as replacement facilities come online, at which point they may be refurbished, repurposed, or in some cases are slated for demolition. As the Legacy transition program proceeds and APF documentation becomes available, pages will be developed and populated for these facilities on this site. In the meantime, contact the FCIS document administrator for assistance with these facilities.</p>

                        NIH APFs are typically cleaned on a regular schedule by a specialty cleanroom cleaning vendor, using pre-diluted solutions, cleanroom wipes and/or mops. 
                        Spot cleaning, when needed, is performed by the end userâ€™s staff, using these same chemicals and processes.  Finish selections (of architectural and MEP finishes) 
                        shall be based on the ability to withstand the frequency of cleaning and sanitization agents used within the facility, cleaning method, 
                        order of application and  contact time.  Following is a listing of the typical cleaning and sanitization agents used at the NIH APFs:
