Some oscillation within an HVAC system is normal due to the built-in timing constraints of control system components and dynamically changing variables in load demands, however excessive oscillation is indicative of a loss of control. A similar qualitative evaluation can be applied to excessive time for recovery from a normal event, such as a door opening. A trend of any of these operating parameters towards its alert level or a temporary, unplanned loss of redundancy in the systems which create and sustain the environment are not considered a loss of state of control, but per SOP will be investigated and mitigated. Sustained operation beyond alert level is considered a loss of control. </span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in .65pt .0001pt 1.2pt;"><strong>User Requirement Specification (URS):</strong> A document that describes the project requirements and acceptance criteria for a facility. The URS describes process and system flows, as well as warning and alert values for environmental constraints. This document is authored during predesign and progressively updated through the life cycle of a facility to be current. This document is subject to change control.</p>

<p style="margin: 0in .65pt .0001pt 1.2pt;"><strong>Validation:</strong> Establishing documented evidence that a process or system, when operated within established parameters can perform effectively and reproducibly to produce a product meeting its predetermined specifications and quality attributes. Validation is establishing documented evidence to provide a high degree of assurance that a specific system, process or facility will consistently produce a product meeting its predetermined specifications and quality attributes.

<p style="margin: 0in .65pt .0001pt 1.2pt;"><strong>Validation Master Plan (VMP):</strong> A user-initiated, multidisciplinary document which creates the structure for the quality management process, including all validations required to open and operate an APF. It shall identify processes and equipment to be validated, the schedule of their performance/time constraints, and the periodicity or conditions for required revalidation. The VMP should establish the philosophy, intentions, and approaches for establishing validation adequacy, as well as requirements for execution and reporting. The VMP shall be reviewed not less than annually, and the plan for that review shall be incorporated into the VMP. The VMP shall take into account all applicable regulations, codes, guides, SOPs, GDP, and GMP. This document is subject to review and sign-off, under document control.</p>

<p style="margin: 0in .65pt .0001pt 1.2pt;"><strong>Vector:</strong> In molecular cloning, a vector is a DNA molecule used as a vehicle to artificially carry foreign genetic material into another cell, where it can be replicated and/or expressed.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in .65pt .0001pt 1.2pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in .65pt 12.9pt 1.2pt;"><strong>Work Zone:</strong> An area within the cleanroom which is designated for clean work and for which CPT is required. The work zone shall be identified by an entrance and exit plane normal to the airflow (where there is unidirectional airflow).</p></p>
