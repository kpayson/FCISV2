          A robust facility compliance program is essential to ensure the
          Aseptic Production Facilities (APF) at the NIH meet the design intent
          and continuously operate in a state of control. Compliance can be
          defined as a state of being in accordance with established guidelines
          or specifications or, as efforts to ensure that organizations are
          abiding by both industry and government regulations.
