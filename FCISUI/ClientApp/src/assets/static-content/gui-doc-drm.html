                <p>A current version of Chapter-13, separate from the current, online version of the whole DRM. DRM
                    Chapter-13, was developed to address the unique needs of design, construction, commissioning,
                    qualification, validation, operations, and maintenance of Aseptic Processing Facilities. This
                    chapter is extracted here for quick reference, but should always be read in the context of the full
                    DRM.
