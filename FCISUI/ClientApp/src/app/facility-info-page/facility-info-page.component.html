            The National Institute of Health Clinical Center (CC) Pharmacy will operate the Permanent
            Intravenous Admixture Unit (I-IVAU) which will provide a wide variety of compounded sterile drug
            products to Clinical Center patients. The P-IVAU space will be located within the Building 10
            Clinical Center on the first floor. The overall P-IVAU space will be approximately 10,000 gross
            square feet of program space, with 5,500 gross square of APF spaces. The facility will prepare drugs
            according to the requirements of USP&lt;797&gt;, USP&lt;800&gt;, USP&lt;795&gt; and BSL-2 standards.
        </p>
        <div *ngIf="showAllMessage">
            <p>
                The APF spaces consists of one (1) &lt;797&gt; suite for sterile non-hazardous IV preparations, one (1)
                &lt;800&gt; suite for preparation of sterile hazardous preparations, and one (1) BSL-2 suite for
                hazardous sterile preparations.

            </p>
            <p>The &lt;797&gt; sterile non-hazardous suite consists of six (6) ISO 7 compounding rooms, each with a Type
                A2 ISO 5 BSC and dedicated incoming and outgoing ventilated pass-throughs. The suite will have separate
                gowning and de-gowning rooms with a common ISO 7 corridor that serves the compounding rooms. The rooms
                will be arranged so pressure is cascading out from the ISO 7 Sterile Prep room out to the common
                corridor and to the ISO 8 gowning and de-gowning room. </p>
            <p>
                The &lt;800&gt; sterile hazardous suite consists of four (4) ISO 7 compounding rooms, each with a Type
                B2 ISO 5 BSC and dedicated incoming and outgoing ventilated pass-throughs. The suite will share the
                entry gowning room with the BSL-2 suite but will be have dedicated entry to a common corridor that
                serves the four (4) rooms. The two (2) &lt;800&gt; rooms will share a common de-gowning room. The suite
                is unidirectional so the worker will exit the compounding room through a de-gowning room, thus avoiding
                re-entry into the entry corridor where cross contamination could occur between compounding rooms. The
                rooms will be arranged so the &lt;800&gt; rooms are negatively pressurized relative to the common
                corridor, but the suite itself is possible to common spaces.

            </p>

            <p>
                The BSL-2 sterile hazardous suite consists of two (2) ISO 7 compounding rooms, each with a Type B2 ISO 5
                BSC and dedicated incoming and outgoing ventilated pass-throughs. The suite will share the entry gowning
                room with the &lt;800&gt; suite but will be have dedicated entry to a common corridor that serves the
                two (2) rooms. The two (2) BSL-2 rooms will share a common de-gowning room. The suite is unidirectional
                so the worker will exit the compounding room through a de-gowning room, thus avoiding re-entry into the
                entry corridor where cross contamination could occur between compounding rooms. The rooms will be
                arranged so the BSL-2 rooms are negatively pressurized relative to the common corridor, but the suite
                itself is positive to common spaces.

            </p>
            <p>
                There will be two (2) kitting rooms in the pharmacy where drug and supplies will be stored. One (1)
                kitting room is for non-hazardous drug and supply storage, and one (1) kitting room for &lt;800&gt;
                Hazardous drug storage. Each kitting room will have a high-density storage carousel designed for use in
                a cleanroom environment.

            </p>
            <p>
                Next to the APF area there will be an Inpatient Unit Dose Section that serves patients that are staying
                and being treated in the hospital. This area will feature a large robotic prescription dispensing
                system, a high-density carousel, refrigerators, shelves, and a workstation area for 4-6 people. There
                will also be an Outpatient Section which serves medications to patients that are being treated as
                outpatients. This section includes an Outpatient Waiting Area with three (3) consultation windows for
                outpatients for pick up. Finally, there will be two (2) additional high-density carousels that will
                store Investigational drugs and drugs that are shared between Inpatient and Outpatient departments.
            </p>
            <p>
                A new mechanical penthouse will be installed above an adjacent roof to house (2) dedicated air handling
                units and other necessary HVAC and electrical equipment. The terminal air units that supply and control
                air changes, temperature, humidity, and differential pressure will be located in the mechanical
                interstitial space above the program spaces. All supply air to the classified rooms is HEPA filtered.
                There will be two (2) sets of dedicated exhaust systems, one set for the general exhaust and one set for
                the hazardous exhaust.
